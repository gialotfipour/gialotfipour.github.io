      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This user experience project is a study and revamp of the AllTrails app,
        with the aim of helping people feel more confident about a hike before
        going.
      </p>

    <section class="problem-statement">
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        People who use AllTrails rely heavily on the review system to make
        decisions on which trail to explore. A lack of verified reviewers and
        photos in the review area limited the amount of trust users had in the
        app and provided an opportunity for me to improve on.

      <p>8 weeks</p>
    </section>

    <section class="solution">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        I created a review system with brand new categories for users to make
        more detaled reviews, post photos and videos on their reviews, and
        become a verified user that people can follow. This solution provides
        users a sense of freedom and empowerment, enabling them to confidently
        write reviews and explore their area in a new way.

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        The process for this project was very iterative, but here’s the general
        process.

    <section class="define project-stage">
      <h3>DEFINE</h3>
      <p>
        In the define phase, I focused on understanding the problem and the
        users. I created a list of assumptions about the current audience, then
        conducted interviews and created personas to pull out key insights.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="test project-stage">
      <h3>TEST</h3>
      <p>
        In the test phase, I set off to conduct one-on-one user interviews, and
        created user personas to pull out key insights and common themes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="ideate project-stage">
      <h3>IDEATE</h3>
      <p>
        Moving into ideation, I created a set of visions and goals and strategy
        statement to better understand the design scope, and explore possible
        design solutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="design project-stage">
      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        In the design phase, I did what you can imagine- design! I began with a
        set of sketches, then eventually moved onto mockups.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="the-impacto project-stage">
      <h2>The Impact</h2>
      <p>
        This project created the opportunity for AllTrails users to have a
        customizable experience when creating a review, increased user trust
        with the implementation of photo and video reviews, and allows users to
        create a catalogue of past experiences to look back at their past hikes
        and reminisce.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="insight-tools project-stage">
      <h2>Insight Tools</h2>
      <p>
        I used various insight tools that helped me collect and interpret data
        to better the user experience by identifying user behaviours,
        preferences, and pain points. Let’s check them out!

    <section class="user-flows project-stage">
      <h3>USER FLOWS</h3>

      <p>
        This is a user flow of the AllTrails enhanced review system, and was
        created to ensure that all points of the flow were completed, as well as
        pinpointing any missing pages or areas of potential confusion.

    <section class="wireframes project-stage">
      <h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
      <p>
        My wireframes began as a series of sketches where I could brain dump any
        and all ideas and room for improvement. Drawing things loose and fast
        really helps get the creative juices flowing!
      </p>

      <img src="img/wireframesketches.png" alt="Screenshots of Wireframes" />

      <p>
        From there, I moved on to mid-fidelity wireframes on Figma to begin
        putting everything together.

    <section class="learnings project-stage">
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        This project gave me the opportunity to explore the process of a UX
        Designer, from defining the problem to creating solutions and
        implementing them. I learned the importance of testing assumptions and
        hypotheses before implementing them to eliminate bias, leveraging tools
        such as user flows and user stories to gain a deeper understanding of
        peoples wants, needs, barriers, goals, and frustrations, and starting
        with a multitude loose concepts and ideas before committing to a final
        design. Overall, this was one of the first projects I completed in
        University and it helped me gain a way better understanding of the
        design process and built my skills as a designer.
