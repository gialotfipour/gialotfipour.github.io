    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This user experience project is a study and revamp of the AllTrails app,
        with the aim of helping people feel more confident about a hike before
        going.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="problem box">
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        People who use AllTrails rely heavily on the review system to make
        decisions on which trail to explore. A lack of verified reviewers and
        photos in the review area limited the amount of trust users had in the
        app and provided an opportunity for me to improve on.

    <section id="solution">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        I created a review system with brand new categories for users to make
        more detailed reviews, post photos and videos on their reviews, and
        become a verified user that people can follow. This solution provides
        users a sense of freedom and empowerment, enabling them to confidently
        write reviews and explore their area in a new way.

    <section id="define">
      <h3>DEFINE</h3>
      <p>
        In the define phase, I focused on understanding the problem and the
        users. I created a list of assumptions about the current audience, then
        conducted interviews and created personas to pull out key insights.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="test">
      <h3>TEST</h3>
      <p>
        In the test phase, I set off to conduct one-on-one user interviews, and
        created user personas to pull out key insights and common themes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ideate">
      <h3>IDEATE</h3>
      <p>
        Moving into ideation, I created a set of visions and goals and strategy
        statement to better understand the design scope, and explore possible
        design solutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="design">
      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        In the design phase, I did what you can imagine; design! I began with a
        set of sketches, then eventually moved onto mockups.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Impact">
      <h2>The Impact</h2>
      <p>
        This project created the opportunity for AllTrails users to have a
        customizable experience when creating a review, increased user trust
        with the implementation of photo and video reviews, and allows users to
        create a catalogue of past experiences to look back at their past hikes
        and reminisce.
      </p>

      <section id="Insighttoold">
        <h2>Insight Tools</h2>
        <p>
          I used various insight tools that helped me collect and interpret data
          to better the user experience by identifying user behaviours,
          preferences, and pain points. Let’s check them out!
        </p>

        <!--Image of user flow below this text-->

        <h3>USER FLOWS</h3>

        <p>
          This is a user flow of the AllTrails enhanced review system, and was
          created to ensure that all points of the flow were completed, as well
          as pinpointing any missing pages or areas of potential confusion.
        </p>

        <section id="wireframes">
          <h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
          <p>
            My wireframes began as a series of sketches where I could brain dump
            any and all ideas and room for improvement. Drawing things loose and
            fast really helps get the creative juices flowing!
          </p>

          <!--Place image of sketch wireframes below-->

          <p>
            From there, I moved on to mid-fidelity wireframes on Figma to begin
            putting everything together.
          </p>

          <section id="What I learned">
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
              This project gave me the opportunity to explore the process of a
              UX Designer, from defining the problem to creating solutions and
              implementing them. I learned the importance of testing assumptions
              and hypotheses before implementing them to eliminate bias,
              leveraging tools such as user flows and user stories to gain a
              deeper understanding of peoples wants, needs, barriers, goals, and
              frustrations, and starting with a multitude loose concepts and
              ideas before committing to a final design. Overall, this was one
              of the first projects I completed in University and it helped me
              gain a way better understanding of the design process and built my
              skills as a designer.
