      <p>
        Hi, I’m Gia, a UX design student with a passion for research,
        accessibility, and crafting intuitive experiences. I am currently
        pursuing a Diploma in Interaction Design at Capilano University,
        specializing in Interaction Design, to bring together a story and design
        solutions that truly meet user needs. I believe in empathy-driven,
        data-backed design—understanding real people, their frustrations, and
        their goals, to create products that feel intuative and meaningful. My
        goal is to work with a company that values UX as a core driver of
        innovation and gives me the creative freedom to solve problems in new
        and impactful ways. Outside of design, I’m crazy for travel. Exploring
        new places allows me to connect with people I might’ve never met
        otherwise, and learn from their stories—an experience that deeply
        affects me as a person, and what I design for.
